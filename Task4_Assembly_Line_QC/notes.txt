Dataset: Images from assembly line camera feed.

Classes:
- 0: Non-defective product
- 1: Defective product

Preprocessing Steps:
1. Resize images to 224x224 pixels.
2. Normalize pixel values (0â€“1 range).
3. Apply data augmentation (rotation, flipping).
4. Split dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.

Model Details:
- CNN or YOLO-based object detection.
- Trained on AWS SageMaker with GPU instance.
- Model exported as .pt or .onnx file for edge deployment.

Deployment:
- Edge inference using AWS IoT Greengrass.
- Real-time defect alerts sent to AWS CloudWatch or factory dashboard.
