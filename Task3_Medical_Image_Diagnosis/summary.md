# Task 3 – AI-Powered Medical Image Diagnosis

Problem Description:
Radiologists often face challenges in diagnosing diseases from medical scans due to the high volume of images and time constraints.  
AI can assist by automatically identifying patterns and highlighting abnormal regions in X-ray or CT images.

Target Users: Radiologists, healthcare organizations, diagnostic centers  
Pain Points: Time-consuming manual diagnosis, limited radiologist availability, risk of human error


Proposed AI/ML Solution:
- Collect medical imaging data (e.g., chest X-rays, CT scans).  
- Store data securely in **AWS S3** or **Azure Blob Storage**.  
- Preprocess images — resize, normalize, and augment using Python libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow.  
- Use a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** or **Transfer Learning** (ResNet, MobileNet) model to detect diseases such as pneumonia or lung cancer.  
- Train and evaluate the model using **AWS SageMaker** or **Azure Machine Learning**.  
- Deploy the trained model as a **Flask** or **Streamlit** web application for radiologists to upload images and view predictions.  
- Monitor performance using **AWS CloudWatch** or **Azure Monitor** dashboards.


Cloud & Tech Stack:

|   Component             |   Technology Used                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Data Storage            | AWS S3 / Azure Blob Storage                |
| Data Preprocessing      | OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras                  |
| Model Training          | CNN / Transfer Learning (ResNet, MobileNet) on AWS SageMaker / Azure ML |
| Model Deployment        | Flask / Streamlit App                      |
| Monitoring              | AWS CloudWatch / Azure Monitor             |


Expected Outcome:

- Enables faster and more accurate diagnosis of diseases.  
- Reduces radiologist workload and improves patient outcomes.  
- Provides consistent, reliable, and scalable diagnostic support.
