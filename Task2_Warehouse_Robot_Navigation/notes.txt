Dataset: LIDAR and camera data from warehouse environment.

Sensors:
- LIDAR: Measures distance to obstacles in 360Â°
- Camera: Captures RGB images of surroundings

Models:
1. CNN Model for Obstacle Detection
   - Input: Image frames from camera
   - Output: Bounding boxes or obstacle labels

2. RL (Reinforcement Learning) Model for Path Optimization
   - Input: Obstacle map, current position
   - Output: Optimal movement direction (forward, left, right)

Cloud Integration:
- AWS Greengrass connects robots to AWS Cloud.
- IoT messages transmitted via MQTT.
- Monitoring via AWS CloudWatch (path accuracy, collision alerts).
