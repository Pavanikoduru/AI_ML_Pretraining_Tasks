# Task 5 â€“ Healthcare Chatbot for Patient Support

Problem Description:
Patients often face long wait times and limited access to healthcare professionals for basic queries, appointment booking, and medicine reminders.  
A conversational AI chatbot can provide 24/7 support, reduce hospital workload, and improve patient satisfaction.

Target Users: Patients, healthcare providers, clinics, hospitals  
Pain Points: Limited human support, delayed responses, lack of medical guidance

Proposed AI/ML Solution:
- Collect FAQs, appointment data, and symptom descriptions from hospitals.  
- Preprocess data and train a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model (BERT / GPT / Rasa NLU).  
- Integrate the chatbot into a web or mobile interface.  
- Use a backend (Flask / FastAPI) connected to hospital APIs for appointments, prescriptions, and reminders.  
- Deploy the solution using AWS or Azure cloud services with monitoring tools.

Cloud & Tech Stack:

|   Component             |   Technology Used                         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| NLP Model               | BERT / Rasa NLU / GPT                     |
